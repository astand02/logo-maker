  ## Installation
  In your command line, type "node -v" to determine if Node.js is installed. You may install Node.js from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) if you do not have it installed. The next step is to clone this repository to your computer, then install dependencies by using the command "npm install".

  ## Usage 

  Once dependencies are installed you may open a new terminal and begin your logo by typing "node index.js". The terminal will then walk you through a series of questions allowing you to personalize your own logo. When you are done answering all the questions a .svg file should be automatically saved in your folder, the file can then be altered to your liking.
